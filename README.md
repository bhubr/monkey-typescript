# Monkey TypeScript

An TypeScript implementation of Monkey interpreter, described in [Thorsten Ball](https://thorstenball.com/)'s book [Writing An interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/).

I'm doing this as a project to:
* Learn TypeScript
* Get my hands dirty instead of just reading the book!
